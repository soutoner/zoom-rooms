# Zoom Rooms

Project with Elixir `backend` and React `frontend` to manage Zoom Room occupancy in real time using websockets.

## Why React

The idea is to integrate it with a React application so other frontends without Elixir/LiveView knowledge can collaborate in the project.

## How to run

1. `cd backend/`
2. Run the project (see `backend/README.md`)
3. `cd frontend/`
4. Run the project (see `frontend/README.md`)
